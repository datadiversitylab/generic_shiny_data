In all years a song contained some unique material and some old material from the previous year...A total of at least 15 themes were present in Tonga from 1991 to 1998...Two different songs were heard in August 1996, which could indicate the migration of a subpopulation of singers to the Tongan grounds or the use of different migration routes. But only the 'new' [1996(2)] song was heard in September, and this suggests that the songs change principally when they are being sung and very little in the summertime where singing is rare, as hypothesized by Payne et al. (1983)...Two themes present in Tonga in 1995 (theme A2 and H) were similar to themes present in East Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in 1994 reported by Helweg et al. (1998), who showed that the South Pacific Group V share songs (see Figure 7). This suggests that whales learn new songs on migration as proposed by Helweg et al. (1992), Helweg et al.

Thus the Tongan song goes through fast-changing years and slow-changing years...When song copying occurs in a population very little individuality exists in an individual whale's song, and this suggests selectivity in copying. If singers imitate the most common song in the population, and in Tonga 1996 it seemed that they did, then variation is eliminated during each sea- son, leaving only the common song form. This leads to uniformity of entire songs over considerable geographic regions (Payne & Guinee, 1983; Helweg et al., 1990; Helweg et al., 1998; Cerchio et al., 2001)...The songs in Tonga seemed to change at the breeding ground since two different songs were present in August 1996, as well as in September 1991. By September 1996 the old song was gone and only the new one heard. Strangely enough there was no hybrid song in 1996 and this suggests that new songs are not simply invented, but they are a learned trait, copied from other whales.

The single most common diet was represented by 23 pairs (21%) that were never observed to take fish during their breeding life-spans. Most of these pairs bred for only one season and failed to fledge any offspring; only one of these pairs bred for as many as three seasons, and only two fledged as many as two chicks over their breeding life-spans...Diets of male, but not female, recruits were correlated with diets of their parents...we examine the diets of banded offspring produced on our study colony that returned to breed within the colony. All 11 banded chicks in this category were male, and established breeding territories that were within 50 m of their natal territories...Female gulls are less philopatric than males, as was expected; in general, male birds show much stronger natal philopatry than do females (Greenwood 1980, Greenwood and Harvey 1982). In contrast to male recruits, banded female offspring during their first year of breeding showed no dietary relationship to their parents...In gulls, the dominant offspring within a brood is known to defend one or both of its parents against its siblings as a ""feeding territory"" away from the natal colony (Drury and Smith 1968). The dominant offspring is typically the oldest and largest male within a brood, or the sole surviving male (Briggs 1977; R. Pierotti, unpublished data)....This suggests that the large numbers of birds that feed largely or primarily on human refuse (scavengers) are probably excluded siblings (females and smaller males), which are prevented by their dominant sibling from accompanying their parent(s) during foraging, and which congregate around predictable sources of lower quality food, such as refuse dumps, picnic areas, or intertidal zones (e.g., Niebuhr 1983, Sibly and McLeery 1983, Irons et al. 1986).
